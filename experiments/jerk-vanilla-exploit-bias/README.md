Vanilla JERK - Exploit Bias Comparison
--------------------------------------

This experiment is designed to shed some light on the behavior of
different values for `exploit_bias` in vanilla JERK. The probability
of performing an _exploit_ is `exploit_bias + (current_timestep /
max_timestep)`, so a larger `exploit_bias` is directly proportional to
the frequency of exploitation.


This experiment tests `exploit_bias`es from 0 to .9 in increments of
`.1`. Each bias was tested 5 times with one million timesteps on _Sonic
The Hedgehog_ Green Hill Zone - Act 1, an admittedly **easy** level.

`exp.sh` is a script that conducts the experiment in full. Change the
`TRIALS` and `JOBS` parameters according to your own circumstances and
desires.

`analyze.sh` is a script to analyze the results by merging all of the
trials into a single `total.csv` for each bias, and then comparing all
of the `total.csv`s.
