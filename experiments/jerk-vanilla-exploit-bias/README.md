Vanilla JERK - Exploit Bias Comparison
--------------------------------------

This experiment is designed to shed some like on the behavior of
different values for `EXPLOIT_BIAS` in vanilla JERK. The probability
of performing an _exploit_ is `EXPLOIT_BIAS + (current_timestep /
max_timestep)`, so a larger `EXPLOIT_BIAS` is directly proportional to
the frequency of exploitation.

This experiment tests `EXPLOIT_BIAS`es from 0 to .9 in increments of
.1. Each bias was tested 5 times with one million timesteps on Sonic
The Hedgehog - Green Hill Zone - Act 1, an admittedly **easy** level.

`exp.sh` is a script that conducts the experiment in full. Change the
`TRIALS` and `JOBS` parameters according to your own circumstances and
desires.

`jerk-XXexploit-remote.py` is simply `jerk-remote.py` with
`EXPLOIT_BIAS` altered accordingly.
