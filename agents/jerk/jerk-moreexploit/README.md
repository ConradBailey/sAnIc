JERK - More Exploitation
------------------------

In this improvement on JERK the agent will always choose to exploit if
a sequence of behavior leads to completing the level (i.e. achieves a
score >= 9000). This is done by switching `EXPLOIT_BIAS` to 1 after
completing a level, and switching it back to its original value if
after some sequence the end of the level is _not_ reached.

The hypothesis behind this approach is that if a successful sequence
of moves is found, why bother exploring? Just keep doing _whatever
works_! But if that stops working, then perhaps it's not a robust
sequence and we should explore other options.
